Atomoicity
The idea of transaction being one unit of work, that cannot be seperated.
In a transaction, all the queries must be successful as a unit of work, if one query failed the 
transaction should be failed, this property is called atomicity.

An atomic transaction is a transaction that will rollback all the queries if one or more queries failed.
